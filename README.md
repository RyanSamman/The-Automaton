# The Automaton

My submission for the [2023 University of Waterloo Game Dev Club's Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/uw-game-dev-club-fall-2032-game-jam), with the theme being "A Strange Machine".

Preoccupied with the creation of [Lid Astray](https://averyhiebert.itch.io/lid-astray) mere days prior, I started this project 4 hours before the 72 hour deadline. Despite the time crunch, I was still able to score second place in the "Best Use of Theme" category.

A throwback to my [first Cellular Automata project](https://github.com/RyanSamman/ElementaryCellularAutomata/tree/master) years ago, your goal is to defend *The Automaton*, the source of your automatical power. Swarmed by a horde of bugs, you are gifted with a random Automaton to keep them at bay.
